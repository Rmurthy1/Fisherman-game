# Fisherman-game
This is a spritekit game about a man going fishing

We are going to sit at the top of the phone in our boat and we are going to allow the line to sink, flappy bird style.

Fish will swim by and be interested in it (maybe depending on the bait you hook? (future))

You get points based on the amount of fish you catch


# project structure
This should be in MVVM format but I'll probably have to refactor to get there.
- classes: Fish, Hook, Man
- things to keep track of: Score, time, level
- particles: explosion when fish is captured, trails for hook and fish, sparkle when points go up.


# interface

top: we have score and time
below that we have the top of the water and the fisherman and his boat
below that we have the water and the fish (largest area)
below that we have the ground and some graphics?
at the very bottom im not sure what we'll add, have to check other games to see what they do.

# graphics

I'm going to need to find some graphics to make this look good. Will use SF symbols or something for now.

# things to make it interesting
- different types of fish
- different weather
- lures
- powerups
- multipliers
- enemies
- upgrades between levels
- moving the boat around
- things that the hook and line get caught on
- cutting the line loses points
- manouvering the line around obstacles?
